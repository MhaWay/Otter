# Otter Configuration File (Optional)
# 
# This file is OPTIONAL - Otter works perfectly without it!
# All settings have sensible defaults.
#
# If you want to customize Otter's behavior, copy this file to:
#   Windows: %USERPROFILE%\.otter\config.toml
#   Linux/macOS: ~/.otter/config.toml

[network]
# Port to listen on (0 = random port, recommended)
# port = 0

# Enable mDNS for local network discovery
# mdns_enabled = true

# Enable DHT for distributed peer discovery  
# dht_enabled = true

[identity]
# Path to identity file (relative to data directory)
# identity_file = "identity.json"

[logging]
# Log level: trace, debug, info, warn, error
# level = "info"

# Log to file (disabled by default)
# file = "otter.log"

[ui]
# Your display nickname (optional)
# nickname = "Alice"

# Theme (currently only "default" is supported)
# theme = "default"

[oauth]
# Google OAuth2 credentials for GUI authentication
# Get these from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
# client_id = "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com"
# client_secret = "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"

# NOTE: This config file format is a placeholder for future features.
# Currently, most settings are controlled via command-line flags.
# See: otter --help
